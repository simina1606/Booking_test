# booking_test
This is a brief description for an automation test flow using the Page Object Model (POM) for a booking website:

1. **Register Functionality:**
   - Create a `RegistrationPage` class that encapsulates the registration page elements and methods.
   
2. **Login Functionality:**
   - Develop a `LoginPage` class to manage login page elements and actions.

3. **My Account Details:**
   - Establish a `MyAccountPage` class representing the user's account page with relevant elements and actions.

4. **Favorite Page:**
   - Create a `FavoritePage` class to handle the favorite page elements and interactions.

5. **Logout Functionality:**
   - Incorporate a `LogoutPage` class containing the logout page elements and logout action.

By employing the Page Object Model, this structure enhances code maintainability, readability, and reusability, providing a systematic approach for test automation in each functional area of the booking website.
